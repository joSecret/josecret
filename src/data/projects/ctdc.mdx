# The Counter Trafficking Data Collaborative

![Preview](/og-images/projects/ctdc.png)

## **Overview**

# Custom Drupal Website – Modern, Accessible, and Performance-Focused

This project is a fully custom, responsive website built with **Drupal 10/11**, designed to showcase a clean and modern front-end architecture. The implementation was done from scratch without relying on any base theme (e.g., Classy or Stable), allowing for complete control over markup, performance, and maintainability.

## Technologies & Tools

The custom theme was developed using standard Drupal theming practices and tools such as:

- **PostCSS** for modern CSS workflows (autoprefixing, nesting, and optimizations)
- **Twig** templates for clean, semantic HTML
- **YAML configuration** for theme settings, libraries, and breakpoint definitions
- **Drupal's asset library system** to manage CSS and JS files efficiently

## Front-End Features

- **Modern CSS features**: `:is()`, `clamp()`, `grid`, `subgrid`, CSS custom properties
- **Minimal JavaScript**: Used only where necessary, no heavy frameworks
- **No jQuery** dependency (unless required by a contrib module)
- **Mobile-first responsive design**
- **Accessibility best practices**: semantic elements, ARIA where needed, color contrast, keyboard navigation

## Performance Optimization

- Clean and optimized CSS bundles using **PostCSS plugins** (`cssnano`, `autoprefixer`)
- Lazy loading for images and media
- Asset management via Drupal libraries with media queries and scoped loading
- Caching and aggregation through Drupal’s performance settings

## SEO & Semantic Markup

- Well-structured content with attention to headings, metadata, and image descriptions
- Clean URLs via Drupal’s path and alias system
- SEO modules used (e.g., **Metatag**, optional **XML Sitemap**)

## Additional Highlights

- Theme architecture designed for reuse across multiple content types
- Compatible with **Layout Builder** or **Paragraphs** (if used)
- Reusable Twig components and macros for consistent templates
