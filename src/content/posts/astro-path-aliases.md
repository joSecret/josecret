# Clean Imports in Astro with Path Aliases

When working on an Astro project, you quickly realize that importing files can get messy. Nobody enjoys writing imports like this:

```astro
import Header from "../../../components/Header.astro";
import MainLayout from "../../layouts/MainLayout.astro";

````

Itâ€™s not only hard to read, but also painful to maintain when the project grows.
Luckily, Astro (thanks to TypeScriptâ€™s config system) allows us to define path aliases â€“ short and meaningful prefixes for your imports.

---

### Why use path aliases?

- **Cleaner imports** â†’ no more ../../../
- **More readable code** â†’ you instantly know where a file comes from
- **Easier refactoring** â†’ if you move a folder, you donâ€™t need to fix hundreds of import paths
- **Consistency** â†’ everyone on the team imports files the same way

---

### Setting up aliases in Astro

Astro uses TypeScript (or JavaScript) config files to define path aliases.
All you need to do is add a tsconfig.json or jsconfig.json at the root of your project and configure the paths option.

Hereâ€™s an example:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["src/*"],
      "@c/*": ["src/components/*"],
      "@l/*": ["src/layouts/*"],
      "@s/*": ["src/style/*"],
      "@img/*": ["src/assets/img/*"],
      "@data/*": ["src/data/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

What do these aliases mean?

- `@/*` â†’ everything inside the src/ folder
- `@c/*` â†’ components (src/components/)
- `@l/*` â†’ layouts (src/layouts/)
- `@s/*` â†’ styles (src/style/)
- `@img/*` â†’ images and static assets (src/assets/img/)
- `@data/*` â†’ data files (src/data/)

You can, of course, adjust these to match your projectâ€™s structure.

### Using aliases in your code

Instead of writing:

```astro
import Header from "../../../components/Header.astro";
import MainLayout from "../../layouts/MainLayout.astro";
```

You can now simply write:

```astro
import Header from "@c/Header.astro";
import MainLayout from "@l/MainLayout.astro";
```

Much cleaner, right? âœ¨

### Tips & gotchas

- Restart the dev server after changing tsconfig.json
- If youâ€™re using VS Code, it will automatically understand these paths
- Aliases work in both .astro and .ts/.js files

---

### Final thoughts

Path aliases are a small setup step that can make a big difference in how you write and maintain your Astro codebase. Cleaner imports mean less frustration and more focus on building your website.

If youâ€™re starting a new Astro project today, I highly recommend setting up aliases right away â€“ your future self will thank you! ðŸš€
