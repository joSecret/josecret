    aboutMe: "I’m a Drupal Frontend Developer with 15+ years of experience turning ideas into clean, functional, and user-friendly interfaces. While I specialize in the frontend, I also enjoy exploring the full Drupal ecosystem — from content modeling and views to paragraphs, blocks, and custom theming. My workflow is simple and efficient: modular CSS, PostCSS, Single Directory Components, and only the JavaScript that’s truly needed. This keeps my projects fast, lightweight, and easy to maintain. For me, Drupal isn’t just a platform — it’s where I feel at home, building scalable solutions that last and bringing value to projects of all sizes.",
